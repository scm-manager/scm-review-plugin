This documentation describes the usage of scm-review-plugin. It is available in different languages and versions, which can be selected in the menu on the right.

The Review plugin adds the feature of so-called pull or merge requests to SCM-Manager, which allow a "four-eyes-principle" in software development. 
This is usually used when implementing a feature or fixing a bug.
