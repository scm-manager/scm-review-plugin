  scm-review-plugin
</h1>

With the review plugin, the SCM-Manager supports so-called pull or merge requests, which can be used to implement a dual control principle in software development. The process usually looks at the implementation of a feature or the correction of a bug (bugfix).

## Usage

Find out how this plugin can be used on the [user documentation page](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-review-plugin/docs).

## Build and testing

The plugin can be compiled and packaged with the following tasks:

* clean - `gradle clean` - deletes the build directory
* run - `gradle run` - starts an SCM-Manager with the plugin pre-installed and with livereload for the ui
* build - `gradle build` - executes all checks, tests and builds the smp inclusive javadoc and source jar
* test - `gradle test` - run all java tests
* ui-test - `gradle ui-test` - run all ui tests
* check - `gradle check` - executes all registered checks and tests (java and ui)
* fix - `gradle fix` - fixes all fixable findings of the check task
* smp - `gradle smp` - Builds the smp file, without the execution of checks and tests

For the development and testing the `run` task of the plugin can be used:

* run - `gradle run` - starts scm-manager with the plugin pre-installed.

If the plugin was started with `gradle run`, the default browser of the os should be automatically opened.
If the browser does not start automatically, start it manually and go to [http://localhost:8081/scm](http://localhost:8081/scm).

In this mode each change to web files (src/main/js or src/main/webapp), should trigger reload of the browser with the made changes.
